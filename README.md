# iSpace
iSpace is an app for the vision pro that allows users to learn about and interact with the planets in our solar system along with several historical rockets, satellites, and other space-faring ships and a handful of fictional and science fiction ships.

Under the assumption that iSpace is not avaliable on the app store at the time, here is a guide to use iSpace using this repository. 

Tools needed: 
1. Xcode version 15.2+ (able to use Vision Pro Spatial Computing)
2. 10-15 GB of storage space
3. Apple Vision Pro Headset (optional)

How to install: 
1. Click the "Code" drop down and download the project (or clone the repository with Git)
   a. "git clone <repository_url>"
2. Open Xcode
3. Open project in Xcode. Navigate to downloaded project and click on the ".xcodeproj" or ".xcworkspace"
4. Once the project opens, select a simulator or device (under the ▶︎ drop down)
   a. If you do not have a Vision Pro then you can run the Xcode Vision Pro simulator
5. Launch the project and wait for it to build and compile (this may take a while)
   a. If you are running the project on the Vision Pro hardware make sure you are connected to the device and have a strong internet connection before building
