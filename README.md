# iSpace
iSpace is an app for the vision pro that allows users to learn about and interact with the planets in our solar system along with several historical rockets, satellites, and other space-faring ships and a handful of fictional and science fiction ships.

Under the assumption that iSpace is not avaliable on the app store at the time, here is a guide to use iSpace using this repository.
